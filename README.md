# YTDL

This is a small program that I made for personnal use, with it you can download a video or audio from youtube.
You can also download entire playlists in a single command.
There is also a function called "update playlist", which keeps track of the last video you downloaded, and downloads all of the remaining ones. I use it to keep track of my music platlist on youtube.

## Preparation

### Dependencies

Make sure you have python with yt_dlp in your PATH environment

### Env

Create a ```env``` folder at the root of your directory containing 2 files:

- ```last_id.txt``` which should contain a video address like ```dE1HftNpDAw```

- ```vars.py``` which you can complete using ```_vars_model.py```

### Icon (optionnal)

I usually set the icon of my ```.bat``` files as the icons provided here

## Usage

Double click on one of the two bat files and follow the instructions on the terminal !
